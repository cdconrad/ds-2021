    "# Lab 6 - Visually analyze iPhone app downloads\n",
    "*Â© 2021 Colin Conrad*\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 6 of INFO 6270! Last week we explored dataframes. In this lab we will build on those concepts by exploring dataframe visualization methods. Python comes with a few good visualization tools, though (as we will see) they are not a replacement for a good data visualization tool such as Tableau. It would be interesting to have a discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of the tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default visualization library that is leveraged by Pandas is called [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). This library makes it super-fast to create attractive (and publishable) visualizations, and is very flexible. However, this library can also be annoying to get it to do exactly what you want. However, when used with Pandas, some of the more difficult tasks are simplified. In this lab you will visualize a different data frame, and work through many of Pandas' visualization features. We will then finish the lab by exploring [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html), a newer Python visualization library with many beautiful visualization features.\n",

    "**This week, we will achieve the following objectives:**\n",

    "- Visualize a grouped dataframe\n",

    "- Visualize data using Seaborn\n",

According to Gartner, as Q3 2019 [iPhone has seen its year-over-year sales decline by 10\\%](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-11-26-gartner-says-global-smartphone-demand-was-weak-in-thi).

To analyze other factors in its success, we can observe data from the Appstore itself. Using this dataset provided by [Ramanathan on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) we can visualize features of the dataset which might have contributed to the success of the appstore."
