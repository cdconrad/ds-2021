    "Welcome to Week 1 of INFO 6270, Introduction to Data Science! If you got this far, it means that you have successfully launched and/or configured the Jupyter Notebook, likely using the Anaconda framework. Now that we are up and running, it is time to introduce you to some of the key concepts. As you know, much of the material that we will explored in the first 4 weeks has been covered by [Sweigart (2020)](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). We are not going to rip off Sweigart's (rather excellent) book, but will build on many of the concepts he explores. These in-class exercises assume that you have read the recommended weekly readings and have perhaps tried to do some of the exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This week, we will achieve the following objectives:**\n",
    "- Run basic Python scripts\n",
    "- Create Jupyter markdown code\n",
    "- Assign Python variables\n",
    "- Perform basic string manipulation\n",
    "- Debug Python code\n",

    "As you know by now, Python is a high level programming language designed to emphasize readability. There are many reasons why someone might want to use Python, though the main reasons why we have opted to use Python in this course is that it has an extensive list of data science libraries. In fact, you are likely currently using Anaconda, a set of Python tools designed specifically for our use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the very first thing that people do when learning a new programming language is learn how to print `hello world!`. In Python, this is really straight forward. Try running the following code by selecting the cell and clicking `Run` (alternatively, you can select `shift + enter`)."

    "\n",
    "Let's break down the concepts above a bit. First, you probably see the `#prints 'hello world!'` bit at the top. This is a comment. Comments are cool because they describe the code that you are executing, without themselves being executed. These are an essential part of writing good code because they tell other readers what the code does. It might seem silly at first, but once you start collaborating with other people you *will* understand the value of comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing worth discussing is the `print('hello world!')` bit. Python's `print()` function is a default function in Python which prints the string contained within the parentheses in the console.

    "## Objective 2 - Create Jupyter markdown code\n",
    "Perhaps the biggest difference between today's tutorial and the course readings is that we are using a tool called Jupyter. This tool is an essential part of the data scientist's workbench, in part because it helps solve one of the biggest problems facing data scientists: *documentation*. Using Jupyter, we are able to effectively share code, but perhaps more importantly, to describe it. In many ways, the art of documentation is a subject in its own right, which we will touch on throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are divided into a series of cells, which each contain code that can be written and transferred however you would like. You have already created and executed a cell in Challenge Question 1, when you created your first Python code. What is less obvious is that even this text is written in a cell! **Try double-clicking on this cell to see its code**. The difference between this cell and the previous is that this cell consists of documentation code, rather than Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Jupyter notebooks support creating documentation using a type of code called *Markdown*. Unlike Python, which is designed to process logic, Markdown is designed to facilitate the creation of text. In other words, Markdown is not a programming language; rather it is a *markup language*. More specifically, Markdown is a derivative of the hypertext markup language (a.k.a. HTML) and builds on HTML's fundamentals. If you have ever taken an introduction to webpage design course, markdown will be very familiar to you; you can even create markdown text using HTML code!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not get into the details on how to create markdown files today, though we will slowly build this skill up as we make out way through the course. For now, the most important things that you need to know are that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can specify the type of code that each cell belongs to using the dropdown box immediately to the right of the `Run` button.\n",

In Python, variables can consist of many different types of data, such as: numbers (called 'variables'), decimals (called 'floats'), words (called 'strings), and more complex data structures which we will explore later. Using data stored in variables, we can create code that does virtually anything that we can imagine!\n",

Python has a number of default features that make it easy to change strings to suit our needs. For instance, Python treats strings as a series of elements (often called an 'array') which makes it easy to break them apart. If we wanted to retrieve the first character in the `course_title` string, we could easily retrieve it by using the following code."
