    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 10 of INFO 6270! Last week marked an important milestone, in the sense that you completed the second course unit on core data science skills. Starting this week, we will have three labs on \"other skills\" that are valuable to data scientists but do not constitute the core practices. This week we will change gears into a topic that is important to most data-related careers: SQL. Many former students have stressed the importance of having basic knowledge of this topic in the workforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of you are likely to have covered SQL in other courses and this lab assumes that you have seen it before. If you have not explored SQL before, I strongly recommend that you spend a few hours working your way through this week's reading. The Khan Academy [Intro to SQL: Querying and managing data](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql) is an excellent course and may be interesting to you even if you have covered it before. It is important to qualify that they use MySQL, which is ever-so slightly different from the tool that we will use this week: SQLite. The principles are the same regardless.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This week, we will achieve the following objectives:**\n",
    "- Create a SQL table with Python\n",
    "- Conduct simple SQL queries\n",
    "- Create relations between tables\n",
    "- Conduct a more complex SQL query\n",
    "- Create and query a relational table"

    "# Case: Kobo Inc.\n",
    "[Rakuten Kobo Inc.]( https://www.kobo.com/) is a Canadian company which sells e-books, audiobooks and e-readers and is a competitor to Amazon's bookselling business. Founded as a subsidiary of the Indigo Books and Music Inc., in 2010 Kobo was spun off as an independent company in order to form partnerships with other book retailors which whished to compete with Amazon. The company was later acquired by Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten and today competes with Amazon for e-book dominance in Canada and Japan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like many e-commerce companies, Rakuten Kobo keeps a database of products for download. Though it is unclear whether they use an SQL database specifically, it is likely that the company stores its inventories using a relational database framework. As an e-commerce company, they maintain an inventory of thousands of items, many of which are related to transactions which happen every day. In this lab we will explore hypothetical data structures which may be similar to the technology that Rakuten Kobo uses on the backend. "

    "If you have [kept up with this week's readings](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql), you likely already know that SQL stands for _Structured Query Language_ and is the standard method for communicating with a relational database. Databases are the backbone of virtually every information system used in businesses and organizations. Relational databases are the most common variety of database; it is not difficult to see why using and managing SQL is important. In fact, _**MI, MDI and MBA students who work for companies or governments consistently express to me that this skill is among the most important skills for securing gainful employment*_. If you have not done a module on SQL, I strongly recommend that you at least look through the Khan Academy materials!\n",

    "It will probably be no surprise to you by now that you can also connect to an SQL database using Python. In this lab we use a simple SQL database called [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). Without going into the details of SQLite, just know that this is a fully functional SQL database that is optimized for small datasets. We will use Python' `sqlite3` library to create, query and retrieve data from an SQLite database. You can read the [documentation for this library here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html).\n",

    "### A bit more about relational databases\n",
    "Relational databases have been around a long time (in computer years) and were originally proposed by E. F. Codd (1970). What makes relational databases different from data tables (which we have explored so far) is that they actually consist of many tables which *relate* to one another in a variety of ways. For example: \n",
    "- The Government of Canada may maintain a table of citizens and a table of passports. Each passport belongs to exactly one citizen and each citizen may have a passport. This is an example of a one-to-one relationship.\n",
    "- A library database could have table of patrons and a table of books. This is a one-to-many relationship. Each patron could borrow many books, though each book only lent to one patron at a given time.\n",
    "- A university database may have table consisting of courses and a table consisting of students. This is a many-to-many relationship. Each course contains many students and each student takes many courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entity in a relational database is typically represented by a key. For now, we will only focus on the `primary key`, a unique indicator of each entry in a table. Primary keys are the way that you can navigate relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating a table. In SQL you can create a table using the CREATE TABLE command. We will create a table for e-readers called *readers* which will contain the following information:\n",
    "- id (integer, primary key)\n",
    "- date_added\n",
    "- model (unique)\n",
    "- description\n",
    "- quantity\n",
    "- price\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQLite data types\n",
    "The following command executes the order to create this table. Note that the command to create table column must also specify the data type. The following are some SQL data types for your reference with their python equivalent in brackets:\n",
    "- integer (integer ... aka complete numbers)\n",
    "- real (float ... aka decimal value)\n",
    "- text (string)\n",
    "- blob (binary number)\n",
