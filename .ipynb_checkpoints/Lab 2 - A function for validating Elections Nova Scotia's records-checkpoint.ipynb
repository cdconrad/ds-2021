    "# Lab 2 - A function for validating Elections Nova Scotia's records\n",

    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 2 of INFO 6270, Introduction to Data Science! Last week we explored basic concepts in Python which we will draw from throughout this course. This week will explore a few more basic concepts, but this time, we will do so with a concrete goal. By the end of this week, you will know how to create a function for validating data. This is an essential skill that will help us greatly when exploring more advanced concepts in data science. This week, we will start our first case-based example using [Nova Scotia Public Housing for Seniors data](https://data.novascotia.ca/Community-Services/Public-Housing-Units-Nova-Scotia-Seniors/2d4m-9e6x). \n",
    "\n",
    "As before, much of the material that we will explored in the first 5 weeks has been covered by [Sweigart (2020)](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), in this case Chapters 2 and 3. If you have not done the readings, you should certainly do so, because this week's challenges will build off of those concepts. \n",

    "**This week, we will achieve the following objectives:**\n",
    "- Specify conditional controls\n",
    "- Loop across string characters\n",
    "- Create a function for performing basic math\n",
    "- Create a function with flow controls\n",
    "- Create a function for validating string data\n",

    "## Case: Elections and Nova Scotia Public Housing for Seniors\n",
    "Elections Officers in Nova Scotian municipalities often need to determine whether a building requires an accessible poll, which is decision made based on whether there are sufficient voters with accessibility needs living in the building. When below a 40 units, it often makes financial sense to provide transportation accommodations for people with accessibility requirements to help travel to the relevant poll, rather than pay elections officers to work at a poll for so few people. However, when over a certain threshold, it is  more affordable to provide a poll in a building or city block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it may also make sense to move the district's voting poll to the vicinity of the seniors' residence. In order to run a public poll, the location should have public amenities, such as public water and public sewer, as well as over 100 units in the building. It is thus desirable to label buildings based on whether they require an accessible poll and whether they should be considered for a full public polling location. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a task which could be done manually by opening the `ns_housing.csv` file and observing the relevant fields. Consider opening the file in Excel. You will quickly realize that manually investigating these cells would be frustrating and potentially very time consuming. Rather than manually reading the number for hundreds of values, we could  use Python to automate this task. Though we do not yet know how to work with CSV files in Python, we will lay the foundations of tools to automate this data entry task."

    "In Week 1, we discussed one of the fundamental distinguishing factors of programming languages: the fact that they are designed to process logic. Python is thus designed to work similarly to everyday language. For those of you who took INFO 5590 and did the **_required_ readings by [Sweigart (2020)](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter2/)**, you would find something oddly familiar in the text. He opens with a flow diagram expressing the logic behind whether to bring an umbrella. This is fundamentally similar to the business process model notation (BPMN) explored in that class! Figure 1 (below) outlines one of the examples that we explored.\n",

Using this logic, we could construct elements of this example. Try running the code below."
