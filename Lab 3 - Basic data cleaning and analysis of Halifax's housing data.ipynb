    "# Lab 3 - Basic data cleaning and analysis of Halifax's housing data\n",

    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 3 of INFO 6270! Last week we explored two key elements of the Python programming lanaguage: loops and functions. These skills are the essential building blocks of virtually all work in data science. This week we will explore two basic data structures: lists and dictionaries. This week's case is built on data from rental data in Halifax from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and may actually provide you with useful insight in your search for housing. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are still working our way through [Sweigart (2020)](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). A word of caution about this week's readings: though much of it is relevant, some of it goes too deep! I recommend looking thorugh these challenge questions to see what may be most relevant before undertaking the readings. For instance, we will not explore tuples and will only use a few of the list methods that he describes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This week, we will achieve the following objectives:**\n",
    "- Make and manage a lists\n",
    "- Use a function to interpret list data\n",
    "- Assess list data quality\n",
    "- Make and manage a dictionary\n",
    "- Analyze where rent is growing fastest\n",

    "# Case: Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation\n",
    "The [Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy19rwKFGYk#action=share) is a crown corporation with a mandate to assist housing for Canadians. Founded shortly after the second world war, its purpose was once to find housing for veterans. Now it provides programs for making mortgages more affordable and enforces policies designed to make rent more accessible. The CMHC also provides data on rental affordability, including [information on the average price of rent](https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en#TableMapChart/0580/3/Halifax%20CMA) for various regions in Halifax through its information portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most information portals, CMHC's is built to make the most important information accessible. This has the unfortunate consequence of also making it difficult to retrieve the data that you need. To retrieve rental price data, you must first select your appropriate data boundary and then select `Primary Rental Market` and `Average Rent ($)`. You can then download data in csv format, similar to the `2019_10_Halifax_Rental.csv` provided to you in Brightspace. Unfortunately, as of December 2020, CMHC does not seem to have data for 2020 (possibly due to COVID-19), which dramatically limits our ability to conduct intersting analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data provided by CMHC is not formatted in a way that is conducive to data science. They provide data in rows and columns, complete with notes at the bottom of the file. It would be desirable to prepare the data in a way that is appropriate for analysis. If we were able to do it in Python, we could sort through hundreds of CSV spreadsheets, such as the rental data for October of each preceding year."
